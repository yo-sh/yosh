### What's the difference

There are many minor differences between Orthic and Yosh but there are three main deviations.

1. The letter V
2. Word position
3. Con- and -sion

### The letter V

The letter **V** is troublesome in Orthic in that it the same a "ste" – a common enough string of letters to be confusing. In English there are only a few words where omitting the **V** would be ambigous; the most frequent are "move", "drive" and "live". In cases where a **V** mid-word would be useful it can me shown as a short vertical line above the word. A word starting with **V** is similar to **S** but written from the bottom of the line up. "Every" and "Very" have their own briefs.

### Word postition

In order where a single syllable word can be written with multiple vowels they are differentiated by if they are written below the line or above. **I** is always above the line. **O** is always written below the line. **A** is generally witten above the line. **E** is usually written below the line but a noticable exption is "get" which is above.

### Con- and -sion

A small circle at the beginning of a word represents "con-" or "com". The same symbol at the end of a word represents "-sion" or "-tion". Mid-word the symbol can be either.
