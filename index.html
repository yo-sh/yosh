  <h1>YOSH – Yellow Orthic Shorthand</h1>

  <p>Yellow Orthic Shorthand (also known as yo-sh or just yosh) is a variant of Orthic Shorthand.</p>

  <h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h3>

  <p>The best place to learn is standard Orthic at </p> <a href="https://orthic.shorthand.fun">https://orthic.shorthand.fun</a>

  <h3 id="whats-the-difference">What’s the difference</h3>

  <p>There are many minor differences between Orthic and Yosh but there are three main deviations.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The letter V</li>
    <li>Word position</li>
    <li>Con- and -sion</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="the-letter-v">The letter V</h3>

  <p>The letter <strong>V</strong> is troublesome in Orthic in that it is the same shape as “ste” – a common enough string of letters to be confusing. In English there are only a few words where omitting the <strong>V</strong> would be ambigous; the most frequent are “move”, “drive” and “live”. In cases where a <strong>V</strong> mid-word would be useful it can me shown as a short vertical line above the word. A word starting with <strong>V</strong> is similar to <strong>S</strong> but written from the bottom of the line up. “Every” and “Very” have their own briefs.</p>

  <h3 id="word-postition">Word postition</h3>

  <p>In order where a single syllable word can be written with multiple vowels they are differentiated by if they are written below the line or above. <strong>I</strong> is always above the line. <strong>O</strong> is always written below the line. <strong>A</strong> is generally witten above the line. <strong>E</strong> is usually written below the line but a noticable exption is “get” which is above.</p>

  <h3 id="con--and--sion">Con- and -sion</h3>

  <p>A small, filled circle at the beginning of a word represents “con-“ or “com-”. The same symbol at the end of a word represents “-sion” or “-tion”. Mid-word the symbol can be either.</p>
